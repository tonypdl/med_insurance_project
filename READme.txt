READme for Medical Insurance Portfolio Project

Given a large CSV, I was tasked with looking it over, 
coming up with a way to tackle the numbers there, and then 
make it come to life with some sort of hypothesis or thoughts.

I had to import CSV into python, make the data usable to do
calculations on, etc. I made lists at first, eventually creating
a master dictionary with keys and values mapping to all the
different records and data points. 

My project took me to deciding to dive into the data and
figure out what each region meant for the costs per individual
when it came to insurance costs. Did it matter where you
lived? I used Matplotlib to make some bar charts that
showcased my findings. 

Check out the script.py file for my raw code,
where I started in python3.

Check out the Jupyter Notebook where I sort of make a
tiny presentation of the program from beginning to end.

Let me know if you have any questions.

This is a project and dataset from Codecademy that I was
able to take in my own direction and put my own spin
on from the ground up.
